# move-ment

An alternative webapp front-end to [http://move-me.mobi](http://move-me.mobi)'s website and mobile app. Check it out live at [https://move-ment.netlify.com](https://move-ment.netlify.com).

## Reasoning

move-me's mobile app is extremely clunky. Its website is decent, but I don't use close to half the functionality they offer.

Furthermore, I wanted a pet project on which to try some technologies -> Therefore, this project was born!
