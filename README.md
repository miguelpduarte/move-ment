[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d8b63afe-6e19-4938-a765-e674831fb029/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/move-ment/deploys)

An alternative webapp front-end to [http://move-me.mobi](http://move-me.mobi)'s website and mobile app. Check it out live at [https://move-ment.miguelpduarte.me](https://move-ment.miguelpduarte.me).

Built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Reasoning

*move-me*'s mobile app is extremely clunky. Its website is decent, but I don't use close to half the functionality they offer.

Furthermore, I wanted a pet project on which to try some technologies -> Therefore, this project was born!
